# pyCamel
This is a TypeScript program meant to convert PyCamel scripts (`.pyc` files), which are Python files with JavaScript-like syntax, into basic Python scripts.

## History
This project was originally started as a way to allow for **camelCase** usage in Python scripts, but that already exists. Wow.
